# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To successfully run this code on your browser or to start the frontend development server follow the steps below:

 1. make sure you are in the `Admin` folder/directory:

        cd admin

 2. install Node Package Manager (npm):

        npm install

 3. Install the following additional packages
       
        npm install axios react-toastify react-router-dom


 4. Start the development Server:
